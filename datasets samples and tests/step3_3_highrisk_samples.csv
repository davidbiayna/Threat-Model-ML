THR-000001,ECommerce - PF,Highly Sensitive data; Security config change,"A malicious actor could attempt to exploit the API by obtaining unauthorized access to Salesforce through the Connected App. If the consumer key and secret for OAuth authentication were compromised, the attacker could potentially impersonate the e-commerce platform and manipulate Salesforce records or access sensitive data. A malicious actor could attempt to exploit the API by obtaining unauthorized access to Salesforce through the Connected App. If the consumer key and secret for OAuth authentication were compromised, the attacker could potentially impersonate the e-commerce platform and manipulate Salesforce records or access sensitive data. The control in place to mitigate the risk involves using OAuth 2.0 authentication with a consumer key and secret, which are generated automatically when the Connected App is created. The API user-dedicated solely for API access and without login privileges is assigned only the necessary permissions for commerce-related tasks. Additionally, system administrators are the only individuals with access to the API credentials in Salesforce, ensuring that the risk of unauthorized access is minimized."

THR-000015,People First Pension Data Service,Highly Sensitive data,A malicious actor that has gained access to the SAP DS server is able to find the password to the service account and move laterally to compromise the customer database. A malicious actor that has gained access to the SAP DS server is able to find the password to the service account and move laterally to compromise the customer database. The Database Service account password is stored encrypted in SAP DS so that it cannot easily found and used.
THR-000016,People First Pension Data Service,Highly Sensitive data,A malicious actor that has gained access to the SAP DS server is able to find a PF PAT token and gain unauthorised access to PF. A malicious actor that has gained access to the SAP DS server is able to find a PF PAT token and gain unauthorised access to PF. The PF PAT token is stored in the SAP DS the Data / Customer Staging database encrypted and is retrieved by SAP DS at runtime of the python script so that it cannot be easily found and used.
THR-000017,People First Pension Data Service,Highly Sensitive data,A malicious actor that has gained access to the SAP DS server modifies the Python script to undertaken malicious actions on PF (e.g. to change bank account details). A malicious actor that has gained access to the SAP DS server modifies the Python script to undertaken malicious actions on PF (e.g. to change bank account details). Write access to the Python script is limited to local admin access only. SAP DS has read and execute access to the script so that this cannot be changed if the SAP DS account is compromised.
